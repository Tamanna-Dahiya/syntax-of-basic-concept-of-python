# List is a data type that stores a set of values of different data types
l1 = [1, 2.0, 3, "4"]

# Indexing and slicing as discussed in strings apply the same concept in lists as well
print(l1[0])
print(l1[2])
l1[2] = 4  # Possible as list is a mutable data type but we cannot do this in strings
print(l1)

# Some functions regarding lists
# Let's discuss the first function sort() that will arrange the list in increasing order
l1.sort()
print(l1)

# To arrange elements of the list in decreasing order use sort(reverse=True)
l1.sort(reverse=True)
print(l1)

# To reverse the list use reverse()
l1.reverse()
print(l1)

# append() - it is used to add an element at the end of the list
l1.append(4)
print(l1)

# To add an element at a specified index we use insert(index, element)
l1.insert(2, 5)
print(l1)

# remove() is used to remove an element (in parentheses you are supposed to give the element which you want to remove)
l1.remove(4)
print(l1)

# pop() - it is used to remove an element from the list which is at the given index
l1.pop(1)
print(l1)

# Mistakes and Refactoring:
# 1. Removed unnecessary comments and corrected grammar.
# 2. Fixed the sort() function usage.
# 3. Improved readability and consistency in comments.

# 4. TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int' yeh isley hua kyuki tune string uar integer value paas kar diya
